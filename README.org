* Alexei Gilchrist

I am an associate professor in quantum information at [[https://mq.edu.au][Macquarie University]], with [[https://arxiv.org/search/quant-ph?searchtype=author&query=Gilchrist%2C+A][research interests]] in quantum characterisation, quantum measurement theory, open quantum systems and quantum computing. Notes for courses I teach are [[https://www.entropy.energy/scholar/][here]]. Also an avid coder, mostly in ~python~. 

** Main public /GitHub/ projects

- [[https://github.com/aalexei/nexus][Nexus]] - a mindmaping app written in ~python~ using ~QT6~. Runs on Macs, Linux, and Windows. I use this for all my lectures, and to organise research topics.
- [[https://github.com/aalexei/graphydb][GraphyDB]] - a local graph database on top of ~SQLite~, powers ~Nexus~ and ~Ook~.
- [[https://github.com/aalexei/poller][Poller]] - a very simple polling app to use in the classroom. Can be used with smartphones/laptops etc to quickly provide a multiple choice poll to a class.
- [[https://github.com/aalexei/mqthesis][MQThesis]] - MQ thesis LaTeX package, also available on [[https://www.overleaf.com/][Overleaf]] (though, seriously, you should be using revision control).
  
** In the pipe line

- ~Ook~ - a reference manager written in ~python~. References and papers organised as a graph with a file store for ~pdf~ and ~djvu~. Using daily, but not quite ready to release. (Ook? What else would the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unseen_University#Librarian][Librarian]] call it?)
